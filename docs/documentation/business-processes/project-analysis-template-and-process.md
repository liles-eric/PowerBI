# **Project Analysis Template**

## **Project Overview**
This template guides the execution of data analysis projects, structured into three main phases: **Planning & Preparation**, **ETL & Analysis**, and **Delivery & Continuous Improvement**. Each phase is broken down into sub-steps for a systematic approach.

---

## **1. Planning & Preparation**

### **1.1 Define the Problem**
- **Objective**: Understand the business need or problem. Engage with stakeholders to identify key questions and define the scope of the analysis.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Clearly outline the problem statement.
  - Identify key metrics and outcomes.
  - Gather initial requirements through meetings, whiteboard sessions, or emails.

### **1.2 Data Collection & Feasibility**
- **Objective**: Identify and collect necessary data sources. Evaluate data availability and accessibility to ensure the required information is available.
- **Best Practices**:
  - List data sources (databases, Excel files, APIs).
  - Assess data quality and completeness.
  - Document potential challenges in data collection or access.

### **Placeholder for Planning & Preparation Tasks**
1. **Define the Problem**  
   Clearly understand the business problem or question that the analysis needs to solve.

2. **Meet with Stakeholder to Verify/Expand on Request**  
   Engage with stakeholders to validate and expand on the initial request, ensuring all aspects of the problem are understood.

3. **Create Key Deliverables and Hypotheses**  
   Define the key deliverables of the project and the hypotheses to be tested during the analysis.

4. **Understand Data Required for the Problem**  
   Identify the types of data needed to address the problem and test the hypotheses.

5. **Determine Where Data is Available**  
   Locate the necessary data sources and assess their accessibility.

6. **Define Risks or Concerns with the Data**  
   Identify potential risks or challenges associated with the data, such as non-standard sources or data that is difficult to access.

7. **Confirm with Stakeholder that All Data Sources are Accurate and Captured**  
   Verify with the stakeholder that all necessary data sources are identified, accurate, and captured.

## **2. ETL & Analysis**

### **2.1 ETL Process**
- **Objective**: Extract, transform, and load data into a workable format. Ensure data is clean, accurate, and ready for analysis.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Connect to data sources and extract relevant data.
  - Standardize and clean data (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values).
  - Transform data to align with analysis needs and load into the analysis tool.

### **2.2 Data Analysis**
- **Objective**: Analyze the prepared data to derive insights, identify trends, and answer the defined business questions.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use appropriate analytical techniques to explore data (e.g., statistical analysis, data visualization).
  - Validate findings against the initial problem statement.
  - Document key insights and conclusions.

### **Placeholder for ETL & Analysis Tasks**
8. **Extract Data from Sources**  
   Connect to the identified data sources and extract relevant data needed for analysis.

9. **Standardize Data**  
   Clean and standardize the extracted data, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent formats.

10. **Transform Data for Analysis**  
    Transform the standardized data to fit the analysis requirements, such as merging datasets, creating calculated fields, and applying filters.

11. **Load Data into Analysis Tools**  
    Load the cleaned and transformed data into the designated analysis tools or platforms (e.g., Power BI, Excel).

12. **Explore the Data**  
    Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data's structure, patterns, and key characteristics.

13. **Apply Analytical Techniques**  
    Use appropriate analytical techniques, such as statistical analysis, trend analysis, or predictive modeling, to derive insights from the data.

14. **Validate Findings**  
    Cross-check the analysis results with the initial problem statement and hypotheses to ensure accuracy and relevance.

15. **Document Key Insights**  
    Record the key findings and insights from the analysis, including visualizations, charts, and narratives that explain the results.

- **After completing this phase, you will have an MVP version of your tool/analysis to present in the next steps.**

---

## **3. Delivery & Continuous Improvement**

### **3.1 Delivery**
- **Objective**: Present analysis results and deliverables to stakeholders. Ensure the outputs meet their needs and expectations.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Share results through reports, dashboards, or presentations.
  - Gather stakeholder feedback and make necessary adjustments.
  - Provide documentation and training as needed.

#### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
- **Definition**: A basic version of the deliverable that meets essential needs with the least effort.
- **Purpose**: Validate the concept and gather initial feedback.
- **Placeholder for MVP Deliverables**
  - [List MVP-specific deliverables here]

### **3.2 Continuous Improvement & Enhancements**
- **Objective**: Refine the process based on feedback and evolving needs. Continuously improve the analysis framework and outputs.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Regularly review and update analysis models and tools.
  - Implement feedback from stakeholders to enhance future analyses.
  - Monitor ongoing performance and adjust as necessary.

#### **Beta Version**
- **Definition**: An intermediate version with most features, used for testing in a real-world environment.
- **Purpose**: Identify and fix bugs, and gather broader user feedback.
- **Placeholder for Beta Deliverables**
  - [List Beta-specific deliverables here]

#### **Production Version**
- **Definition**: The final, polished version ready for full deployment.
- **Purpose**: Deliver a complete and stable product to stakeholders.
- **Placeholder for Production Deliverables**
  - [List Production-specific deliverables here]

### **Placeholder for Delivery & Continuous Improvement Tasks**
16. **Develop MVP for Delivery**  
    Finalize and prepare the MVP version of the analysis or tool for stakeholder presentation.

17. **Gather and Implement Feedback**  
    Present the MVP to stakeholders, gather feedback, and implement necessary changes or enhancements.

18. **Create Beta Version**  
    Develop a more refined version of the analysis or tool, incorporating additional features and improvements based on initial feedback.

19. **Test Beta Version**  
    Test the Beta version in a real-world environment, identify any issues, and make necessary adjustments.

20. **Finalize Production Version**  
    Prepare the final, polished version of the analysis or tool, ensuring all features are stable and fully functional.

21. **Deploy and Document**  
    Deploy the production version to stakeholders, provide documentation, and ensure smooth implementation.

22. **Monitor and Improve**  
    Continuously monitor the performance of the delivered product, gather ongoing feedback, and make iterative improvements as needed.
