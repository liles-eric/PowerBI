- **Purpose**: To show the total revenue for the month.

### Recommended Visuals:

### Example Use Case:

- **Purpose**: To provide a cumulative view of sales performance from the start of the year to the present date.

## 5. Sales Growth

### Business Explanation

### Example Use Case:
- **Report**: Monthly Growth Analysis
- **Purpose**: To analyze the percentage growth in sales from one month to the next.
